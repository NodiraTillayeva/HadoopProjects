Million Song Dataset Challenge

This is a famous Kaggle competition for evaluating a music recommendation system. Users will work on the Million Song Dataset released by the Columbia University’s Lab for Recognition and Organization of Speech and Audio. The dataset consists of metadata and audio features for 1M contemporary and popular songs.

Problem Statement
For a given user, we have their song history and the count on how many times the song was played by a user.  In this big data project, we want to provide a set of recommendations to the user by understanding on how the song history can be used. This can be done by looking at songs which are most similar to user songs and also by grouping similar users based on their listening history. The challenging aspect of this big data hadoop project is to decide on what features need to be used to calculate the song similarity because there is lots of metadata for each song.
